      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
The maintenance of lists of Verifiable Issuers, sometimes referred to as Trusted
Registries, are a well-known concept from the pre-internet age. Whenever there
is a diploma signed by a university, there are people and organizations that
keep track of what universities exist and what methods there are to confirm the
authenticity of that diploma. A list could be maintained by HR staff for the
purpose of hiring personnel based on qualifications asserted by particular
Verifiable Issuers, and the governance of that list would be minimal. Another
list could be maintained by a government, associated with well-governed
accreditation procedures, for the purpose of assuring that a diploma represents
a proper education. Lists of Verifiable Issuers support Verifiers in their
decision to trust the Issuer of a Verifiable Credential that is presented by a
Holder.
      </p>

      <p>
Digitally sharing lists of Verifiable Issuers and Verifiers is a relatively new
concept. Examples are the list of parties that are allowed to use the digital
fingerprint information on the chip of RFID-based digital passports. This is
cryptographically enforced: “chip-says-no” when an unauthorized party attempts
to access this information on the chip. Also eIDAS v2 will have a
Verifiable-Verifiers List that limits the access of Verifiers to credentials in
a EUDI (EUropean Digital Identity) wallet. Verifiable-Verifiers Lists support
Holders and holder implementations in their decision to trust a Verifier to
share a Verifiable Presentation to that Verifier.
      <p>
Lists of Verifiable Issuers and Verifiers help to automate the decision process
of whether to engage with a counterparty in a transaction and make it more
auditable by ensuring that software can note that a party was on a list before
engaging with them. This paper contains the following sections that provide
background on the problem space as well as a proposed set of solutions given the
current state of the market:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Section 2 presents a set of use cases in the digital age that explain the use of
lists of Verifiable Issuers and Verifiers.
        </li>

        <li>
Section 3 analyses prior art such as lists of Verifiable Issuers and Verifiers
that have already been deployed, or that are being developed, as well as a gap
analysis of the current solutions and desired outcomes.
        </li>

        <li>
Section 4 highlights the unified requirements derived from the analysis of prior
art and a conceptual model for sharing lists of Verifiable Issuers and Verifiers
and the format of the entries in the list.
        </li>

        <li>
Section 5 provides a concrete data model and possible serializations, which
could serve as a starting point for future standardization.
        </li>

        <li>
Section 6 discusses possible next steps towards future standardization.
        </li>

        <li>
Section 7 concludes the paper and proposes future work.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
The target audience of this paper are people that know the basics of
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) such as the concepts of Issuer, Holder, Verifier,
and Verifiable Credential. SSI developers may use this document as input and
inspiration for their code and other products. Deployers of SSI use cases may
use this document in the specification process of their deployment.

      <section id="terminology">
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts in this document.
        </p>
<p>
<strong>Credential</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A set of one or more <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-claims">claims</a> made by an <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-issuers">issuer</a>. A
<strong>verifiable credential</strong> is a tamper-evident credential that has
authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be
used to build <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations">verifiable
presentations</a>, which can also be cryptographically verified. The <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-claims">claims</a> in a
credential can be about different <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-subjects">subjects. </a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services
(eIDAS)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>eIDAS</strong> (<strong>e</strong>lectronic
<strong>ID</strong>entification, <strong>A</strong>uthentication and trust
<strong>S</strong>ervices) is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)">EU
regulation</a> on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_identification">electronic
identification</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_service_provider">trust services</a>
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_transactions">electronic
transactions</a> in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Single_Market">European Single
Market</a>. It was established in EU Regulation 910/2014 of 23 July 2014.<sup>
</sup>All organizations delivering public digital services in an EU member state
must recognize electronic identification from all EU member states from
September 29, 2018.
</p>
<p>
<strong>European Digital Identity (EUDI)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The European Digital Identity is based on a European Commission document
called “European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework” that has
established the functional and architectural requirements for an upcoming
European Digital Identity Wallet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Holder</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A role an <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-entities">entity</a> might
perform by possessing one or more <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable
credentials</a> and generating <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-presentations">presentations</a>
from them. A holder is usually, but not always, a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-subjects">subject</a> of the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable
credentials</a> they are holding. Holders store their <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> in <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential-repository">credential
repositories</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Issuer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A role an <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-entities">entity</a> can perform
by asserting <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-claims">claims</a> about one or
more <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-subjects">subjects</a>,
creating a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable
credential</a> from these <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-claims">claims</a>, and
transmitting the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable
credential</a> to a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holder</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level of Assurance (LoA)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The degree of certainty that a relying party can have about the true
identity of someone presenting an identity credential. Four levels of assurance
were outlined by a 2006 document from the US National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST 800-63). The level of assurance is measured by the strength and
rigor of the identity proofing process, the strength of the token used to
authenticate the identity claim, and the management processes the identity
provider applies to it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The act of transferring information from one party to another. This paper
uses the word "sharing" instead of "publishing" as the latter presumes a one-way
and public transfer of information. The <strong>Verifiable
Issuer/Verifier</strong> <strong>lists</strong> described in this paper are made
available in some form or other. They might be pushed to a party or pulled from
a party and might use a public communication channel or a private one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Verifiable Issuer / Verifiable Verifier</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A party that is verifiable might have different levels of trustworthiness
associated with it by different parties. Note that “trusted” or “authorized” are
sometimes used as synonyms for “verifiable”, as the purpose of some lists is to
assure trust or authority. This paper uses the word “verifiable” as no
presumption should be made about the application of the lists, or the
trust/authority that they assure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Verifiable Issuer/Verifier List</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A container that consists of a set of <strong>Verifiable</strong>
<strong>Issuers</strong> or <strong>Verifiers</strong>. The word “list” can be
considered synonymous to “register”, depending on the amount of governance,
assurances and authority associated with it. This paper uses the word “list” and
presumes there will always be some form of governance, if only the establishment
of its purpose and the format of its entries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Verifier</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A role an <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-entities">entity</a> performs by
receiving one or more <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable
credentials</a>, optionally inside a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations">verifiable
presentation</a> for processing. Other specifications might refer to this
concept as a relying party.
</p>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>
This section contains criteria that can be used to determine whether something
does or does not fit a particular terminological definition in the previous
section.
</p>
<p>
<strong>sharing</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables other parties to obtain a copy of a <strong>list entry</strong>
about an <strong>Issuer</strong> or <strong>Verifier</strong> from the
<strong>list</strong>, e.g. in VC format, through DNS query, or other mechanism.
<li>May or may not enable others to obtain a copy of the full contents of a
<strong>list</strong>.
<li>Those others may be anyone in the world, or they may be only those who have
access to the <strong>list</strong> or to a specific entry about an
<strong>Issuer</strong> or <strong>Verifier</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>list</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Contains zero-or-more entries about any <strong>party</strong>.
<li>A list entry contains data about one specific <strong>party.</strong> The
data is specified by the <strong>party </strong>that <strong>governs
</strong>the <strong>list</strong>.
<li>A list is associated with a policy containing one or more criteria that are
used to determine whether or not a <strong>party</strong> qualifies for being
registered in the <strong>list</strong>. Criterion may distinguish between
<strong>parties</strong>, e.g., between parties that are trusted to issue or
verify VCs of a specific kind.
<li>Other parties may use the data in a <strong>list entry </strong>as the basis
for a decision, e.g., to share further information, or to engage in a
transaction. The perceived use of <strong>list entries</strong> by other
<strong>parties</strong> should guide the <strong>party</strong> that governs
the <strong>list</strong> as it specifies the structure of <strong>list
entries</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>parties</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are expected to perform the roles of <strong>issuer</strong>,
<strong>holder</strong>, and <strong>verifier</strong> as well as other
verifiable-credential-related roles (e.g., revocator).
<li>May or may not be a legal authority.
<li>The <strong>party </strong>that manages the list has to be able to precisely
describe the thing that the list entry enables because software will act upon
that machine-readable description. For example, "Issues Student ID cards for
University X".
</li>
</ul>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section id="conformance">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming list</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification. Specifically,
all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#data-model"></a> of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a
<a>conforming list</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when
non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
This document also contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content. Some
of these examples contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON or
JSON-LD.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>
This section outlines use cases that highlight the need for the technology
described in this paper by discussing the use cases in two categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Verifiable Issuers
<li>Verifiable Verifiers
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A final use case section then checks for commonalities and differences between
the two categories
</p>
<p>
There are a number of other locations that have published use cases that are
related to this paper. Rather than include those use cases in this document,
they are included by reference:

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verifiable Issuer Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acme Inc. is a producer of medical equipment. Twin Mountains Hospital
decided to buy equipment from Acme Inc. The law says that medical equipment
should be certified by a 3rd party certification body. Twin Mountains Hospital
requests a certification from Acme, Inc.; Twin Mountains Hospital delivers it to
them. The hospital then checks if Acme Inc. is in the Verifiable Issuer List of
licensed 3rd party certification bodies to see if the Issuer of Acme Inc.'s
certification is an approved certification body.
<ul>
<li>Note: The solution might need to convey a single item in a List vs. the
entire List.
<li>Note: Many similar certification/license use cases are out there.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Walmay, Inc. is a wholesaler of drugs. John & Jane is a manufacturer of
drugs. Walmay, Inc. finds out that a lot of Adenosine Triphosphate drugs has
broken packaging and decides to return the lot to the manufacturer. It is
required that all interactions in the drug market must be done only between
authorized trading partners. John & Jane requests an authorized trading partner
certificate from Walmay Inc. The certificate credential contains a link to the
Issuer. John & Jane then verifies that the Issuer is a member of the
Verifiable-Issuer List of Issuers authorized to issue ATP (Authorized Trading
Partner) credentials.
<li>Elena is an IT Administrator in the hiring department of a mid-size company
that would like to vet job applicants as having received their degrees from an
accredited college or university. Elena configures their hiring software to
refer to multiple lists (Verifiable-Issuer Lists) containing several hundred
organizations that are curated by the various accreditation bodies that they
trust.
<li>Line is elected treasurer of a Dutch church. In her role as treasurer, she
goes online to open a bank account for the church. To comply with certain laws
and adhere to internal risk mitigating policies, the bank needs to verify that
Line has been authorized by the church to sign on its behalf. For companies,
personal information about executive board members is registered by the Chamber
of Commerce alongside the registration of the legal entity. However, due to the
special sensitive nature of data regarding religious affiliations, the Chamber
of Commerce in the case of religious institutions (mosque/synagogue/church) is
prohibited from registering any data that can be correlated with a natural
person. Instead of checking the Chamber of Commerce public register, the bank
requests a credential from Line stating her mandate to sign, which she received
from the church. The bank checks whether the church is on the Verifiable
Issuer-List of Churches, which is maintained by the Chamber of Commerce. Finding
the church on the list, the bank is now able to open a bank account for the
church, which Line can administer.

<ul>
<li>Yuri has a digital driver's license and is attempting to rent a car from
CarMart. CarMart requests to see Yuri's age, motor vehicle class, and driver's
license number. Yuri's software checks against a Verifiable-Verifier List to
make sure that CarMart is a Verifiable authority for information of that type,
so it can warn Yuri if CarMart isn't trusted to request that information from
Yuri.
<li>Oskar joins a tennis club. The tennis club requests a government-issued
proof of birth date. However, the tennis club does not have authorization to ask
for this personal information. As a consequence, Oskar’s certified EUDI wallet
refuses to present the information, based on the absence of the tennis club in
the relevant Verifiable-Verifier List. The tennis club realizes that they cannot
obtain this high-LoA information from the EUDI wallet and instead accepts a
self-asserted date-of-birth by Oskar.
<li>Oskar was invited by the European Commission to become an evaluator. Even
though Oskar would be paid only the equivalent of a book voucher, the EC
requires a full contracting process, which includes an eIDAS LoA high
identification and a recent authentic bank statement. Even though Oskar
considers these requirements unreasonable, Oskar’s certified EUDI wallet accepts
the request, as the EC is registered in the relevant Verifiable-Verifier List.
This way, Oskar knows at least that the request is genuine, and that there
exists a sufficiently-well-governed policy associated with the request.
<li>Oskar crosses the border to Dystopia. Immigration requests that Oskar
surrender all Verifiable Credentials in his SSI wallet, including
identification, driver’s license, diplomas, certifications and other records.
Immigration of this country is not authorized to make such a wide request, as it
is not included in the relevant Verifiable-Verifier List. As a consequence,
Oskar’s certified EUDI wallet refuses to present this information. Even the
threat of denial-of-entry or worse cannot change the situation, as neither
immigration nor Oskar himself is physically able to compromise Oskar’s EUDI
wallet to surrender the information.

<h3>Commonalities and Differences</h3>
<p>
Conceptually and technically, the two types of lists (Verifiable Issuer,
Verifiable Verifier) are fairly similar. Each type is a governed list of parties
with a role in SSI exchanges. Each type needs to provide some form of sharing
(publication/access), so that the list is available to its users. This paper
will presume that the types of lists themselves, as well as their sharing
methods, can be technically identical. The only distinction is that a list could
contain only Verifiable Issuers, only Verifiable Verifiers, or a mixture<sup
id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of both, so the data model
should accommodate this.
</p>
<p>
Major differences arise in the applications surrounding the lists. Verifiable
Issuer lists target Verifier implementations, whereas Verifiable Verifier lists
target Holder (digital wallet) implementations. Also there may be major
differences in the governance between the two types of lists, or whether/how the
consulting of lists is implemented and enforced. All of these differences are
out of the scope of this paper.

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Conceptual Model</h3>
<p>
An Assurance Community is what governs a list of Verifiable Issuers and/or
Verifiers. The community can consist of a single person, a group of people, an
organization, a group of organizations, or any other relevant structure. The
governing can be purely manual, partially automated, or completely automated
through the use of APIs or smart contracts.
</p>
<p>
A list of Verifiable Issuers and/or Verifiable Verifiers contains entries with
information about the Issuers and/or Verifiers that it verifies.This information
can be as minimal as a single DID or public key per Verifiable Issuer or
Verifiable Verifier, or it can also include metadata about each entity and the
services that each entity performs.
</p>
<p>
An Interested Party is an entity that uses one or more entries from the List of
Verifiable Issuers and/or Verifiable Verifiers in a decision making process. An
interested party is typically software that is acting on behalf of an Issuer,
Holder, or Verifier. The party might request the entire List, or portions of the
List over either a public channel, or a private channel.
</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
The following requirements have been specified by the authors. It includes both
requirements on a Verifiable-Issuers/Verifiers List (“a list” in short) as a
whole and its individual entries. These requirements may be updated in the
future.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A list may be created and governed by any individual, group of individuals,
organization, group of organizations, or other.
<li>A list and/or its entries shall be made available to subscribers.
<li>A list and/or its individual entries shall be serializable in one or more
formats such as a Verifiable Credential.
<li>Entries may be made available via a Wallet, a Website, a URI, a QR code, a
DNS Resource Records, DNSSEC, on-chain Ethereum transactions, or other methods.
<li>A list and its entries shall be cryptographically verifiable.
<ul>
<li>A list shall accommodate Different cryptographic mechanisms (X.509, JWK
etc.).
<li>There shall be an ability to authenticate the list or an individual entry.
</li>
</ul>
<li>A list and its entries shall have associated Governance Metadata Format,
including:
<ul>
<li>Policies; and
<li>Qualifier details.
</li>
</ul>
<li>A list and its entries shall be publicly resolvable.
<li>A list and its entries shall be privately transmittable/retrievable.
<li>A list may have metadata associated with it, e.g., metadata that is
applicable to all of its entries.
<li>A list may have different levels of privacy/confidentiality, ranging from
fully public to for-authorized-yes-only.
<li>Entries shall be able to be created, read, and deleted.
<li>Entries may be updated, suspended and/or revoked.
<li>Entries may have an individual level of assurance associated with it.
<li>Entries may have an associated level of assurance.
</li>
</ul>

      <p class="issue">
The only technology approach that we were not able to analyze deeply is
Trinsic's approach. We need to make sure their approach is integrated into and
aligned with the documented use cases, requirements, and the rest of the
document.

      <h2>Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline the data model that is used by this specification
for Verifiable Issuer and Verifier Lists.
      </p>

<p>
The data model described in this section has been built using input from a
variety of the prior art evaluated for this paper including input from the EBSI
Trusted Issuer Registry, ETSI TS 119 612, eSSIF-Lab TRAIN, the Trust over IP
Foundation Trust Registry Protocol, and Rebooting the Web of Trust input
documents. The data model described in this section is capable of expressing
many, but not all, of the concepts described in those other specifications.
</p>
<p>
The unified data model for this work can be represented as a list of service providers
that represent entities or orgnaizations that provides services such as credential issuance or validation. The Data Model also contains the details of the list operator informations.
</p>
